RewRaa (RSA ENCRYPTED WILD ROUND AES APPLICATION, note i have no idea
why i choose that name) is a socket-server chat program which uses rsa
encryption to encrypt an aes key for encrypting/decrypting messages

Imagine the following encryption scheme:

::

    # first transfer aes key
    (CLIENT) => RSA_PUBLIC => (SERVER)
    (SERVER) => RSA_ENCRYPTED_AES_KEY => (CLIENT)

            (C) => ENC_DATA => (S)
                        - BROADCAST -
                        (C) - (C) - (C) # clients decrypt the message

But working to give each client a seprate aes-key and signing the data
so you canâ€™t create a fake server that reads all your data.

NOTE: Only connect to trusted servers for now it has a big security flaw
and the only secure part is if anyone is monitoring your internet
traffic
