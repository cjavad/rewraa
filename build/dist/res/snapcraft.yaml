  RewRaa (RSA ENCRYPTED WORLD RELIC AES APPLICATION, note i have no idea why i choose that name)
  is a socket-server chat program which uses rsa encryption to encrypt an aes key for encrypting/decrypting messages

  Imagine the following encryption scheme.

  first transfer aes key
  (CLIENT) => RSA_PUBLIC => (SERVER)
  (SERVER) => RSA_ENCRYPTED_AES_KEY => (CLIENT)

          (C) => ENC_DATA => (S)
                      - BROADCAST -
                      (C) - (C) - (C)  clients decrypt the message



  But working to give each client a seprate aes-key and signing the data so you can't create a fake server
  that reads all your data. 

  NOTE. Only connect to trusted server for now it has a big security flaw and the only secure part is if anyone is monitoring your internet traffic
